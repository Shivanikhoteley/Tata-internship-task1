Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025 – Task 1

This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Tata Data Analytics Virtual Internship 2025. The task focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Geldium dataset to evaluate data quality and uncover preliminary insights.

🎯 Task Objective

The purpose of this task was to carry out an initial review of the dataset, specifically by:

Identifying missing or incomplete values

Checking for inconsistent records

Detecting outliers in numerical features

Generating basic statistical summaries

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Documentation & Refinement: ChatGPT (for structuring insights and report writing)

📊 Key Deliverables

A detailed data quality assessment report

Statistical summaries of core variables

Visualization of patterns and anomalies

Identification of risk factors linked to credit behavior

🧩 Notes

The dataset was provided in CSV format and processed using Python-based libraries.

Data preparation and analysis were performed through prompt-driven and code-based exploration.

Repository includes both the notebook and the EDA summary report for clarity.

✨ This marks the foundation for further data modeling and predictive analysis within the internship program.
